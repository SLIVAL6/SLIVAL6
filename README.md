## Hi, Iâ€™m Sam
I'm Sam, aka SLIVAL, a student studying software engineering at uni, and game development in my own time. I spend most of my time figuring out why my code is not working, and wasting away on video games! ðŸ˜€

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in games design and development.
- ðŸ¤” I know how to code in Java, C# and SQL.
- ðŸŒ± My current goals are to improve my C++ skills, and to be more adept with Unity.
- ðŸ“« Contact me on Discord: Slival#4064
- âš¡ Fun fact: I play Rainbow Six Siege a lot and just started going to the gym.
